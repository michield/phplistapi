plugin-specific tests.

v1 is stable and will take pull requests and bugfixes.


## About the REST API plugin v2

v2 of the REST API plugin builds on phpList 4. It is under active development
and should be used and extended where possible.

It lives in a [separate repository](https://github.com/phpList/rest-api).

There also is an old, unfinished implementation of the REST API plugin v2 in
the directory [plugins/restapi2/](plugins/restapi2). This implementation will
be removed soon.
